                        <ol class="tipsItem">
                            <li>Doing the home work: Know about the company you are applying for the job before hand, because having knowledge 
                                on the company will help you understand what you are expected to do and how well you can contribute to the 
                                organisation. This also focuses that you are very much interested in the opportunity and can assess the employerâ€™s
                                requirements for the job position.
                            </li>
                            <li>Arrive on Time: Never be late to the interview and the first impression should be the best, navigate the 
                                route beforehand and start from home well in advance to avoid sudden circumstances or traffic issues. Also consider
                                appropriate parking facilities which show that you are well organised and sensible enough. Remember to carry the
                                contact person details with whom you should be meeting for the interview, if not be polite and maintain patience 
                                at the location.
                            </li>
                            <li>Be prepared: The candidate should be well prepared for the interview and be aware of any type of question and should be able 
                                to reply promptly and with confidence. Expect the worst ever questions in the interview, few of the questions are common in nature
                                for eg. Why do you want to work here? Or why should we hire you? Practice a mock interview.
                            </li>
                            <li>Proper dressing sense: The first appearance leaves a positive or negative impression to the interviewer, 
                                so the way you groom and the most appropriate look for an interview is the formal wears keep low profile and simple
                                take care of any tattoos or piercings which will leave an impression that you are not serious about the job.
                            </li>
                            <li>Be confident and active: While facing the interview you should be confident and be energetic with a positive approach for
                                the questions been asked. You should sell yourself effectively and care should be taken not to over emphasize and praise 
                                self too much, just focus on the strengths, abilities, experiences and the skills you possess and can help the organisation.
                            </li>
                            <li>References: References are important to know the conduct of the employee and it is your duty to provide atleast 
                                three references such as former managers, colleagues or senior people with whom you had worked. You should keep in mind 
                                to seek permission before giving the reference contact persons information. Reference checks give an employee a confidence 
                                that the candidate possess and the genuinity of the candidature.
                            </li>
                            <li>Carrying important documents: Copies of resume or any identification proof of documents for the interview need to be carried.
                                In case you do not have the documents which are being asked then make sure that you get them next time or forward in 
                                any other method.
                            </li>
                            <li>Show the participation: After the interviewer had asked you enough questions, be polite and convey that you have few questions, 
                                this will show that you are interested and ask questions which are related to the business or the industry and also shows that 
                                you have the reasonable knowledge about the company and that you have done enough study that you want to be part of it.
